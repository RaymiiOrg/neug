* Major changes in NeuG 0.02

  Released 2012-08-30, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Change RNG constuct.
We replace all basic components.  Now, we use WELL 512a structure
for Physical-based RNG.

** New USB stack.
Now, we use our own USB stack (taken from Gnuk).


* Major changes in NeuG 0.01

  Released 2011-11-14, by NIIBE Yutaka

** Support more boards
NeuG now supports FST-01, STM8S DISCOVERY, CQ-STARM and STBee, too.

** Change RNG construct.
Basic technology is basically same (CRC-16, TinyMT), but we add
FNV32 hash as an output function, and give a seed to TinyMT from
Physical-based RNG.

** Add Test results.
Under test-results directory, we put results of RNG test by rng-tools,
NIST STS 2.1.1, and Dieharder 3.31.1.
