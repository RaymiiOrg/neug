What's NeuG?
============

NeuG is a set of routines of random number generator (RNG) which is
based on physical noise.  It supports STM32F103.  It can be stand
alone USB RNG device (with main routine), too.

The name comes from Japanized English word "noidgy" (from English word
"noisy"), where many Japanese (including me) don't distinguish
pronunciations of "gee" and "zee".  NeuG includes my important letters
of "g", "n", and "u", and the word "neu" (German spelling of "new").

My primary intention was to incorporate NeuG routines into Gnuk for
random number generation, but the stand alone version could be useful
too.

Gnuk was named after my son who loved the pacifier when he was baby.
NeuG was named after my daughter, but I don't say she is noisy.


Release notes
=============

This is the fourth release of NeuG, which is still experimental.
Basic features (generating random numbers) are stable, but newly added
things like reGNUal support should be considered unstable.  Note that
you need the snapshot of ChibiOS/RT (from trunk).  This means that it
is covered by GNU GPL.  No "linking exception" option is available for
the snapshot.


FAQ
===

Q0: How NeuG device is good?
A0: I believe it's good enough if we compare to other hardware RNGs.
    If its usage is as an entropy source for RNG-tools, or use for
    computer simulations, I think that it's good enough.  I evaluated
    it with rngtest of RNG-tools, NIST STS test suite and Dieharder.
    See the directory neug/test-results/.
A0-dash: For better entropy device with embedded test, you could get
         EntropyKey.  See http://www.entropykey.co.uk/
A0-double-dash: STM32F2xx and STM32F4xx have built-in TRNG, it would
                be better for you (although the quality of randomness
                looks not that good).

Q1: How fast is NeuG device?
A1: It's something around 30 Ki-byte/second.

Q2: Should we check condition of noise sources?
A2: Yes, we should.  Three continuous tests are implemented, following
    (Draft of) NIST SP 800-90B.  Those are Repetition Count Test,
    Adaptive Proportion Test (for 64 samples), and another Adaptive
    Proportion Test (for 4096 samples).  When it detect an error (it
    is really rare, but it could occur even for normal condition), the
    generation of random bits restart again.


Targets
=======

FST-01, STBee Mini, Olimex STM32-H103, CQ-STARM, and STBee are
supported.


Souce code
==========

NeuG source code is under src/ directory.


License
=======

It is distributed under GNU General Public Licence version 3 or later
(GPLv3+).  Please see src/COPYING.


External source code
====================

To build NeuG device, we need external source code.

* chibios/  -- ChibiOS/RT 2.3.x snapshot

  Please get it from http://chibios.sourceforge.net/
  We use ChibiOS/RT as the kernel for NeuG device.


How to compile
==============

You need GNU toolchain and newlib for 'arm-none-eabi' target.

See http://github.com/uwehermann/summon-arm-toolchain/ for preparation
of GNU Toolchain for 'arm-none-eabi' target.

Change directory to `src':

  $ cd neug-VERSION/src

Then, run `configure':

  $ ./configure

Type:

  $ make

Then, we will have "neug.elf".


How to install
==============

STBee Mini and STBee
--------------------

Reset the board with "USER" switch pushed.  Type following to write
to flash:

  # cd ../tool
  # ./dfuse.py ../src/neug.hex

Then, reset the board.


Olimex STM32-H103 board
-----------------------

If you are using Olimex JTAG-Tiny, type following to invoke OpenOCD:

  $ openocd -f interface/olimex-jtag-tiny.cfg -f board/olimex_stm32_h103.cfg

Then, with another terminal, type following to write "gnuk.elf" to Flash ROM:

  $ telnet localhost 4444
  > reset halt
  > flash write_image erase neug.elf
  > reset
  > exit
  $ 



Use of NeuG device
==================

It is USB CDC ACM device.  On GNU/Linux, it can be /dev/ttyACM0 or like.
Before using /dev/ttyACM0, you need to configure its TTY discipline.

  $ stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 -echo raw

Then, you can use output of /dev/ttyACM0.

When you want to get raw output (not conditioned), you can configure:

  $ stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 parenb

And you can get conditioned output by configuring:

  $ stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 -parenb

Here is a figure of the circuit.

 Random Number Output


STM32F103 has two built-in A/D converters of 12-bit resolution.  NeuG
uses LSBs of A/D converters' outputs as entropy sources.  It is
considered noise of quantization error, plus noise from power supply,
etc.

We chose analog inputs of IN10 and IN11, which is not connected to
external pin (for the version of 36-pin or 48-pin STM32F103).  The
input is configured as digital output 50MHz to get maximum noise of
environment.

By 556 samplings of two channels, we can get 1112-bit, as we can get
two bits (LSB of IN10 and LSB of IN11) from one sampling.  We put this
1112-bit and half of previous output to conditioning component.

Conditioning component is implemented by Hash_df function by SHA-256.
Since the noise source is not "white", signal is whiten by this
Conditioning component.

Experiments show that raw noise source of LSBs has more than 6.0
bit/byte entropy when it is no computation but just to take samples.
The entropy varies among different boards.  It seems that a board with
good power supply and capacitor has smaller entropy (6.2 or so), and
the one with poor power supply and capacitor has bigger entropy (7.3
or so).  That is considered noise of quantization error.

When there is some activities of MCU, it's more than 7.0 bit/byte
entropy for a board even with good power supply and capacitor.

My experience with STM32F103 and NeuG shows that noise source is
stable at least for a year.


Test results
============

See files under the directory test-results, for test result of
"rngtest" in rng-tools, NIST STS 2.1.1, and Dieharder.

For Dieharder, I correct 13GiB (it took five days and six hours
and more), and use scripts to invoke dieharder.

Known Problem(s)
================

On STBee (high-density device of STM32), sometimes, I observed stall
of generation of random number, after two hours, two hours and half,
etc.

Identified somehow.  When it stalls, status is like this (by OpenOCD, GDB):

	adcp->state = ADC_ACTIVE
	main thread: wait on condition variable at neug_get
	rng thread: holding rb->m, event wait at rng_gen for ADC_DATA_AVAILABLE
	idle thread: running
	LED thread: event wait

Kicking DMA controller again (note: ADC is continuous mode, no need to
kick), by doing following:

  (gdb) set ADCD1.dmastp->channel->CCR = 0
  (gdb) set ADCD1.dmastp->channel->CNDTR = 8
  (gdb) set ADCD1.dmastp->channel->CCR = 0x258f
  (gdb) x/x 0x40020000		# DMA interrupt status register (DMA_ISR)
  0x40020000:	0x00000007

Then, it goes again.

Lost DMA finish interrupt?
